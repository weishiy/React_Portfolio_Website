This project was created by following a YouTube tutorial that demonstrates how to build a responsive portfolio website using React and CSS. The tutorial covers everything from structuring the project to deploying it.

You can watch the tutorial here: [YouTube Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQCDUJ6hhNY)

## Deployment

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages using the b1 branch. Only the Vite-generated dist folder content is pushed to the b1 branch for deployment, which is slightly different from the approach shown in the tutorial.
